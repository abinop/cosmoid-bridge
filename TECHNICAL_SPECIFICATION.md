# Cosmoid Bridge Technical Specification

## Overview
Cosmoid Bridge is an Electron-based application that serves as a bridge between web applications and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. It provides a WebSocket server interface for web clients to interact with BLE devices, specifically designed for Cosmoid hardware.

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Main Process** (`src/main/index.js`)
   - Initializes the Electron application
   - Creates the system tray
   - Manages the main window
   - Initializes BLE and WebSocket servers

2. **BLE Server** (`src/main/ble-server.js`)
   - Handles all BLE device interactions
   - Manages device discovery and connections
   - Handles characteristic reading/writing
   - Emits device events

3. **WebSocket Server** (`src/main/ws-server.js`)
   - Provides WebSocket interface for clients
   - Bridges BLE events to connected clients
   - Handles client commands
   - Broadcasts device updates

4. **Renderer Process** (`src/renderer/index.js`)
   - Provides UI for device management
   - Connects to WebSocket server
   - Displays device status and controls

## Communication Flow

### 1. BLE Device Discovery
1. Client sends discovery request via WebSocket
2. WebSocket server forwards request to BLE server
3. BLE server initiates device scanning
4. Discovered devices are broadcast to all connected clients
5. Scanning continues until explicitly stopped or timeout reached

### 2. Device Connection
1. Client requests connection to specific device by MAC address
2. WebSocket server validates request and forwards to BLE server
3. BLE server attempts connection
4. Connection status updates are broadcast to all clients
5. Upon successful connection, device services and characteristics are discovered

### 3. Data Exchange
1. **Reading Data**
   - Client requests characteristic read
   - Request routed through WebSocket â†’ BLE server
   - Data returned via same path in reverse
   - Notifications/Indications handled similarly

2. **Writing Data**
   - Client sends write request with data
   - Data validated by WebSocket server
   - BLE server performs write operation
   - Write confirmation broadcast to clients

## Security Considerations

### WebSocket Security
1. Local-only connections (127.0.0.1)
2. Optional authentication token
3. Request validation and sanitization
4. Rate limiting for connections and requests

### BLE Security
1. Device whitelisting
2. Encryption support (if provided by device)
3. Connection timeout management
4. Automatic disconnection on idle

## Error Handling

### WebSocket Errors
1. Connection failures
2. Invalid message format
3. Authentication failures
4. Rate limit exceeded

### BLE Errors
1. Device connection failures
2. Read/Write operation failures
3. Device disconnections
4. Scanning failures

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Management
1. Maximum concurrent connections
2. Scanning duration limits
3. Memory usage monitoring
4. CPU usage optimization

### Latency Optimization
1. Message queuing
2. Batch operations where possible
3. Connection pooling
4. Event debouncing
